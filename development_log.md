# 3D Game Development Log

## Project Goal
To create a basic web-based 3D application displaying basic shapes with user-controlled movement using Three.js.

## Steps Taken

1.  **Project Setup**: Created the project directory `c:/Users/iman2/Desktop/Vibe Coding a 3D Game`.
2.  **HTML Structure (`index.html`)**: Created `index.html` with a canvas element and links to the Three.js library, `style.css`, and `script.js`.
3.  **Basic Styling (`style.css`)**: Created `style.css` to style the body and canvas for a full-window display.
4.  **Three.js Scene Setup (`script.js`)**:
    *   Initialized a `THREE.Scene()`.
    *   Initialized a `THREE.PerspectiveCamera()`.
    *   Initialized a `THREE.WebGLRenderer()` targeting the canvas.
    *   Set the renderer size.
    *   Created a `THREE.BoxGeometry()` and `THREE.MeshBasicMaterial()`.
    *   Combined them into a `THREE.Mesh()` and added it to the scene.
    *   Set the camera's initial position.
5.  **Animation Loop**: Implemented an `animate()` function using `requestAnimationFrame` to continuously render the scene and update object properties (currently rotating the cube).
6.  **Window Resizing**: Added an event listener to handle window resizing and update the camera aspect ratio and renderer size.

## Tips for Expansion

Here are some ideas and tips for expanding this basic 3D scene into a more complete game:

1.  **Add More Objects**: Create different geometries (spheres, cylinders, custom shapes) and materials to add more objects to the scene.
2.  **Textures and Materials**: Explore more advanced materials like `MeshLambertMaterial` or `MeshPhongMaterial` and learn how to load and apply textures to your objects for more visual detail.
3.  **Lighting**: Add different types of lights (`AmbientLight`, `DirectionalLight`, `PointLight`, `SpotLight`) to illuminate your scene and create shadows.
4.  **User Input for Movement**: Implement event listeners for keyboard or mouse input to control the camera or specific objects in the scene, allowing for navigation or interaction.
5.  **Physics and Collision Detection**: Integrate a physics engine like Cannon.js or Ammo.js (a WebAssembly port of Bullet) to add realistic physics simulations and detect collisions between objects.
6.  **Load 3D Models**: Learn how to load external 3D models in formats like glTF, OBJ, or FBX using Three.js loaders.
7.  **Animation**: Implement more complex animations for objects, either through code or by using animated 3D models.
8.  **Game Logic**: Develop game-specific logic, such as scoring, levels, enemy AI, and win/loss conditions.
9.  **Optimization**: As your scene grows, learn about techniques to optimize performance, such as frustum culling, level of detail (LOD), and efficient rendering practices.
10. **Audio**: Add sound effects and background music using the `THREE.AudioListener` and `THREE.Audio` classes.
11. **User Interface (UI) **: Create a 2D UI overlay using HTML, CSS, or a library like `dat.gui` for debugging and controlling game parameters.
12. **State Management**: For larger games, consider using a state management pattern or library to manage the game's state.
