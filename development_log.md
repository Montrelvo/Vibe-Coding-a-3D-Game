# 3D Game Development Log

## Project Goal
To create a basic web-based 3D application displaying a basic room with simple shapes and user-controlled movement using Three.js, with a future direction towards a God game where the player controls minions/followers.

## Steps Taken

1.  **Project Setup**: Created the project directory `c:/Users/iman2/Desktop/Vibe Coding a 3D Game`.
2.  **HTML Structure (`index.html`)**: Created `index.html` with a canvas element and links to the Three.js library, `style.css`, and `script.js`. Updated `index.html` to use module type for script.js.
3.  **Basic Styling (`style.css`)**: Created `style.css` to style the body and canvas for a full-window display.
4.  **Three.js Scene Setup (`script.js`) - Initial Cube**:
    *   Initialized a `THREE.Scene()`.
    *   Initialized a `THREE.PerspectiveCamera()`.
    *   Initialized a `THREE.WebGLRenderer()` targeting the canvas.
    *   Set the renderer size.
    *   Created a `THREE.BoxGeometry()` and `THREE.MeshBasicMaterial()`.
    *   Combined them into a `THREE.Mesh()` and added it to the scene.
    *   Set the camera's initial position.
5.  **Animation Loop - Initial Cube**: Implemented an `animate()` function using `requestAnimationFrame` to continuously render the scene and update object properties (initially rotating the cube).
6.  **Window Resizing**: Added an event listener to handle window resizing and update the camera aspect ratio and renderer size.
7.  **Implemented Basic 3D Room (`script.js`)**:
    *   Removed the initial cube.
    *   Created geometries and materials for the floor and walls using `THREE.BoxGeometry` and `THREE.MeshBasicMaterial`.
    *   Created meshes for the floor and walls and added them to the scene.
    *   Adjusted the camera position to be inside the room.
    *   Removed the cube rotation logic from the `animate()` function.
8.  **Added Right-Click Camera Control (`script.js`)**: Implemented event listeners for mouse down, mouse up, and mouse move on the canvas to enable camera rotation when the right mouse button is held down and the mouse is moved. Prevented the default context menu on right-click.
9.  **Added Keyboard Camera Movement (`script.js`)**: Implemented event listeners for keydown and keyup to track pressed keys and added logic in the `animate` function to move the camera forward (W), backward (S), rotate left (A), and rotate right (D) based on key presses.
10. **Refactored Code into Separate Files**:
    *   Created `js/scene.js` to handle scene, camera, renderer, and room creation.
    *   Created `js/controls.js` to handle mouse and keyboard camera controls.
    *   Updated `script.js` to import and use functions from `js/scene.js` and `js/controls.js`.

11. **Using a Local Server**: Started a local HTTP server (`python -m http.server 8000`) to serve the files, which is necessary for running the project with JavaScript modules.
12. **Code Review**: Reviewed the code in `index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`, `js/scene.js`, and `js/controls.js` for errors and potential issues. No major errors were found in the current implementation.

## Tips for Expansion

Here are some ideas and tips for expanding this basic 3D room scene into a more complete game, with a focus on the God game concept:

1.  **Minion/Follower Implementation**: Create simple 3D models or shapes to represent minions. Implement logic for their behavior, such as pathfinding, task execution, and interaction with the environment.
2.  **God Abilities/Interactions**: Design and implement abilities that the player (as a God) can use to influence the minions or the environment. This could involve clicking on objects/minions to issue commands, creating resources, or altering the terrain.
3.  **Resource Management**: Introduce resources that minions can gather or process. Implement a system for tracking resources and how they are used.
4.  **Goal/Objective System**: Define goals or objectives for the player to achieve by directing their minions.
5.  **Advanced Camera Controls**: While basic movement is implemented, consider adding features like zooming, panning, or different camera perspectives suitable for a God game.
6.  **UI for God Abilities and Information**: Create a user interface to display information about minions, resources, and available God abilities.
7.  **More Complex Environment**: Expand the room into a larger environment with different areas, obstacles, and interactive elements.
8.  **AI for Minions**: Develop more sophisticated AI for minions to handle complex tasks and respond to the environment.
9.  **Visual Feedback for Abilities**: Add visual effects to represent God abilities or minion actions.
10. **Saving and Loading**: Implement functionality to save and load the game state.
11. **Sound and Music**: Add audio to enhance the gameplay experience.
12. **Optimization**: Continuously optimize the scene and game logic as complexity increases.
