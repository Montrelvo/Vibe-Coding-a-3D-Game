# 3D Game Development Log

## Project Goal
To create a basic web-based 3D application displaying a basic room with simple shapes and user-controlled movement using Three.js.

## Steps Taken

1.  **Project Setup**: Created the project directory `c:/Users/iman2/Desktop/Vibe Coding a 3D Game`.
2.  **HTML Structure (`index.html`)**: Created `index.html` with a canvas element and links to the Three.js library, `style.css`, and `script.js`.
3.  **Basic Styling (`style.css`)**: Created `style.css` to style the body and canvas for a full-window display.
4.  **Three.js Scene Setup (`script.js`) - Initial Cube**:
    *   Initialized a `THREE.Scene()`.
    *   Initialized a `THREE.PerspectiveCamera()`.
    *   Initialized a `THREE.WebGLRenderer()` targeting the canvas.
    *   Set the renderer size.
    *   Created a `THREE.BoxGeometry()` and `THREE.MeshBasicMaterial()`.
    *   Combined them into a `THREE.Mesh()` and added it to the scene.
    *   Set the camera's initial position.
5.  **Animation Loop - Initial Cube**: Implemented an `animate()` function using `requestAnimationFrame` to continuously render the scene and update object properties (initially rotating the cube).
6.  **Window Resizing**: Added an event listener to handle window resizing and update the camera aspect ratio and renderer size.
7.  **Implemented Basic 3D Room (`script.js`)**:
    *   Removed the initial cube.
    *   Created geometries and materials for the floor and walls using `THREE.BoxGeometry` and `THREE.MeshBasicMaterial`.
    *   Created meshes for the floor and walls and added them to the scene.
    *   Adjusted the camera position to be inside the room.
    *   Removed the cube rotation logic from the `animate()` function.

8.  **Added Right-Click Camera Control (`script.js`)**: Implemented event listeners for mouse down, mouse up, and mouse move on the canvas to enable camera rotation when the right mouse button is held down and the mouse is moved. Prevented the default context menu on right-click.

## Tips for Expansion

Here are some ideas and tips for expanding this basic 3D room scene into a more complete game:

1.  **Add More Objects**: Create different geometries (spheres, cylinders, custom shapes) and materials to add more objects to the scene (furniture, props, etc.).
2.  **Textures and Materials**: Explore more advanced materials like `MeshLambertMaterial` or `MeshPhongMaterial` and learn how to load and apply textures to your objects for more visual detail on the room surfaces and objects.
3.  **Lighting**: Add different types of lights (`AmbientLight`, `DirectionalLight`, `PointLight`, `SpotLight`) to illuminate your room scene and create shadows.
4.  **User Input for Movement**: Implement event listeners for keyboard or mouse input to control the camera's movement within the room, allowing for navigation.
5.  **Physics and Collision Detection**: Integrate a physics engine like Cannon.js or Ammo.js (a WebAssembly port of Bullet) to add realistic physics simulations and detect collisions between the camera/player and the room walls or objects.
6.  **Load 3D Models**: Learn how to load external 3D models in formats like glTF, OBJ, or FBX using Three.js loaders to add more detailed objects to the room.
7.  **Animation**: Implement more complex animations for objects within the room.
8.  **Game Logic**: Develop game-specific logic that takes place within the room environment.
9.  **Optimization**: As your scene grows, learn about techniques to optimize performance.
10. **Audio**: Add sound effects and background music to enhance the room environment.
11. **User Interface (UI) **: Create a 2D UI overlay for game elements.
12. **State Management**: For larger games, consider using a state management pattern or library.
